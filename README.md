The two algorithms of dueling bandits idea are from Papers <<Bandits Dueling on Partially Ordered Sets>> and <<Dueling Bandits with Weak Regret>>, which are part of the implementation.

Other versions of dueling bandits algorithmic code can be find in :[https://github.com/methi1999/dueling-bandits](https://github.com/methi1999/dueling-bandits)
