# Dueling-Bandits
The two algorithms of dueling bandits idea are from the following Papers, which are part of the implementation.
[Bandits Dueling on Partially Ordered Sets](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6808-bandits-dueling-on-partially-ordered-sets.pdf)

[Dueling Bandits with Weak Regret](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04304) 

Other versions of dueling bandits algorithmic code can be find in :[https://github.com/methi1999/dueling-bandits](https://github.com/methi1999/dueling-bandits)
